# Ollama Container

Container images for running Ollama models on the container platforms.

- GitHub: [https://github.com/entelecheia/ollama-container][repo-url]
- Ollama: [https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama)

Get up and running with large language models locally.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- NVIDIA Docker (for GPU support, Optional)

## Build and Run

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   make docker-build
   ```

   The `docker.app.env` file includes various configuration options and environment variables. The `docker-compose.app.yaml` file uses these variables to customize the behavior of the services. This is a common practice when you want to set different configurations for development, testing, and production environments. The `Dockerfile.app` file uses these variables to customize the Docker build. These files are automatically generated by Copier when you run the `copier copy` command.

2. Start the Docker container:

   ```bash
   make docker-up
   ```

   This will start a Docker container with the image built in the previous step. The container will run a bash lauch script that starts the application.

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it ollama-default-app-1 ollama run llama2
   ```

## Usage

After starting the container, you can access the application at `localhost:<CONTAINER_HOST_WEB_SVC_PORT>`. By default, the port is set to `11434`.

## Volumes

The `docker-compose.app.yaml` file specifies several volumes that bind mount directories on the host to directories in the container. These include the cache, the workspace directory, and the scripts directory. Changes made in these directories will persist across container restarts.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with this setup, please check the following:

- Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed correctly.
- Make sure NVIDIA Docker is installed if you're planning to use GPU acceleration.
- Ensure the environment variables in the `docker.app.env` file are correctly set.
- Check the Docker and Docker Compose logs for any error messages.

## Environment Variables

In Docker, environment variables can be used in the `docker-compose.app.yaml` file to customize the behavior of the services.

The `docker-compose` command has an `--env-file` argument, but it's used to set the environment variables for the services defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file, not for the `docker-compose` command itself. The variables defined in the `--env-file` will not be substituted into the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

However, the environment variables we set in the `.docker/docker.app.env` file are used in the `docker-compose.app.yaml` file. For example, the `$BUILD_FROM` variable is used to set the base image for the Docker build. Therefore, we need to export these variables to the shell environment before running the `docker-compose` command.

This method also allows us to use shell commands in the variable definitions, like `"$(whoami)"` for the `USERNAME` variable, which wouldn't be possible if we used the `--env-file` argument. Shell commands in the `.env` file are not evaluated.

### Files for Environment Variables

- `.docker/docker.common.env`: Common environment variables for all Docker images.
- `.docker/docker.app.env`: Environment variables for the Docker image.
- `.env.secret`: Secret environment variables that are not committed to the repository.
